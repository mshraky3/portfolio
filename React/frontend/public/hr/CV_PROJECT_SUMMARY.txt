                    HR MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - CV PROJECT SUMMARY
================================================================================

PROJECT TITLE: Enterprise HR Management System (Multi-Branch Architecture)

ROLE: Full-Stack Developer (Solo)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              THE PROBLEM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Educational institutions and healthcare centers managing multiple branches faced:

• Manual employee data tracking across 25+ branches with inconsistent formats
• No centralized document management - critical documents (contracts, IDs, 
  passports) scattered with no expiry tracking
• Paper-based absence/payroll tracking prone to errors and delays
• No visibility into document expirations causing compliance issues
• Complex Arabic/Hijri date requirements not supported by standard tools
• Bus transportation management done through spreadsheets
• No unified reporting - managers spent hours compiling data manually
• Branch managers couldn't track their staff data independently

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              THE SOLUTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Built a comprehensive web-based HR management system featuring:

EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT
  - Full CRUD with multi-branch employee assignment
  - Automatic data completion validation (tracks missing required fields)
  - Support for various employment statuses (active/pending/terminated/resigned)
  - Smart duplicate detection with merge capabilities

DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT
  - Centralized document storage with automatic expiry tracking
  - Branch-level and employee-level document management
  - Version control and verification system
  - Proactive alerts for expiring documents (30/60/90 day warnings)

REPORTING & ANALYTICS
  - PDF report generation with full Arabic RTL support
  - Excel exports for data analysis
  - Real-time dashboard with role-specific views
  - Employee statistics, branch comparisons, salary analysis

BUS TRANSPORTATION MODULE
  - Complete fleet management (buses, drivers, licenses)
  - Student assignment and tracking
  - Driver license and vehicle registration document management
  - Transportation reports

PAYROLL & ABSENCE TRACKING
  - Monthly absence cycles with controlled submission windows
  - Branch-by-branch submission tracking
  - Automatic window opening on last day of each month

NOTIFICATION SYSTEM
  - Importance-level notifications (urgent/normal/info)
  - Branch-specific targeting
  - Response tracking and read receipts
  - Email alerts for critical notifications

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              TECHNICAL STACK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BACKEND:
  - Node.js 20+
  - Express.js 5.1.0 (REST API)
  - PostgreSQL (Neon serverless)
  - JSON Web Tokens (Authentication)
  - Nodemailer (Email service)

FRONTEND:
  - React 19.2.3
  - Vite 5.4.0 (Build tool)
  - React Router 7.12.0
  - Recharts (Data visualization)
  - react-window (Virtual scrolling for large lists)

CLOUD SERVICES:
  - Vercel (Serverless deployment)
  - Vercel Blob Storage (Document storage)
  - Neon PostgreSQL (Serverless database)

SPECIALIZED LIBRARIES:
  - @digicole/pdfmake-rtl: Arabic RTL PDF generation
  - ExcelJS: Excel report generation
  - pdf-lib: PDF manipulation and merging
  - Custom Hijri-Gregorian date converter (Kuwaiti Algorithm)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              DATA & SCALE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DATABASE STRUCTURE:
  - 25 relational tables
  - 18 JavaScript model classes
  - 11 database migrations
  - Complex relationships (employees ↔ branches ↔ documents ↔ notifications)

CODEBASE SIZE:
  - ~20,000+ lines of custom code
  - 24 API route files
  - 50+ React page components
  - 37 reusable React components
  - 31 utility modules

KEY FILE COMPLEXITIES:
  - Employee routes: 4,748 lines (full CRUD + statistics + reports)
  - Employee model: 1,279 lines (complex business logic)
  - Dashboard: 1,629 lines (task prioritization + role-based views)
  - Database init: 1,622 lines (25 table schemas + indexes)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CACHING STRATEGY:
  - In-memory cache with configurable TTL (5s - 5min by endpoint)
  - Request deduplication (prevents duplicate concurrent API calls)
  - Branch data cached at 5-minute intervals
  - Statistics endpoints cached for 1 minute
  - Prefix-based cache invalidation for related data

DATABASE OPTIMIZATIONS:
  - 11+ strategic composite indexes:
    • idx_employees_status_branch (partial index for active employees)
    • idx_notifications_active_expires (notification queries)
    • idx_employee_documents_emp_active (document lookups)
    • idx_employees_id_number_active (duplicate detection)
  - Reduced connection pool (25 → 8 max) for serverless
  - Batch INSERT operations using PostgreSQL unnest()
  - N+1 query elimination (JOIN consolidation)

FRONTEND OPTIMIZATIONS:
  - Virtual scrolling for large employee lists
  - Parallel API batching
  - Report preview pagination (50 records in preview, full data in export)
  - useMemo/useCallback for expensive computations
  - Lazy loading of route components

NETWORK OPTIMIZATIONS:
  - Gzip compression (60-80% response size reduction)
  - Minimal JSON payloads
  - Efficient blob storage URLs (signed URLs, direct streaming)
